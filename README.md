# Javascript War Game

Using only Javascript this project lets you play the card game War in the console of your window.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
The list of things you need to enjoy this game is pretty short:

- A browser that can access the developer console (preferably Google Chrome).
- Git on your computer

And thats it! With these two things you can be playing a game of War in no time!

### Installation
1. Create a new folder where you want the repository to be downloaded
2. In your terminal, use the `cd` command to change directories into the folder you just created
3. Now copy the SSH link from the green button on Github that says "Clone or Download"
4. Back in your terminal, use the command `git clone [The SSH you just copied]` to clone the repository down to your computer
5. In the highest folder in the repo (the one you made and no lower) do the command `open lib/index.html` to open the index file in your default browser
6. Right-click the webpage and use the "Inspect" option to open the developer tools menu
7. In the menu click the "Console" tab and type `war.playCards()` to start the first round
8. Each round enter the command again to play a new set of cards until one person has collected the entire deck!

## Suggestions
I'm always looking to learn and grow as a developer. Even though this is one of my first projects I'm not afraid of critisism. Please don't be afraid to give me suggestions to add to make the game look or run better.
